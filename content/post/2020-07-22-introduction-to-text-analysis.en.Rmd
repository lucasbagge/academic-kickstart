# Introduction

In todays world there is social media and other online sources with information. Why not exploder these and make analysis. But it is not numbers? Numbers isnÂ´t the only think you can analysis. When you have an resturant you are interting in your [EBITA](https://www.shareholders.dk/investorordbogen/1117/ebita) but you might bee equally interesting in an customer review on trip advisor. The only problems is that if you are owner of a big chain then 1000 of reviews might takes you some time to read though.

It is where Text mining comes in. Text mining is an automatic process that uses natural langauge to extract valuable information from unstructed text to data a model can understand and analysis can draw conclusion on. So from a small to a big business owner one can use text mining to reduce task, get to know ones customer and used data in the most essentiel ways.

There is a lot to do with text mining and different methods and techniques. Because the toolbox is so big it is worth to take a deep drive into what the termology is and get a generel view of the usable practise.
